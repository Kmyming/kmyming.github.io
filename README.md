# kmyming.github.io - my personal website!
## Hey there!
This is the respository for my personal website! Do check it out at https://kmyming.github.io/.
I post my work, my travel experiences, and ocassionally, some posts on my blog...
This is a work in progress, and will be updated when I'm free! I hope you look forward to the updates I bring on to the website to make it unique and interesting!

Website made with HTML, Vanilla CSS and Vanilla JS.

## Updates:
4/1/2021: v1.0

Version 1 of the website completed! Content for 'about', 'my work' with some basic JavaScript for automatic carousel, modals and navigation bar for mobile.


20/1/2021: v1.1

Minor edits to the website to make it run smoother and load quicker, through compressing and properly sizing images, and eliminating render-blocking resources. Hopefully the website loads a tad bit faster now!
